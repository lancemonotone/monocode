An AngularJS interface utilizing the WordPress REST API. Developed for Williams College, this is a simple app which allows users to select a dining facility and daypart to view the specified menu. This was my first foray into Angular. The WP side consumes a csv file provided by NetNutrition, an antiquated 3rd-party database, converts it to JSON and distributes it to the Angular client via the WP API.
